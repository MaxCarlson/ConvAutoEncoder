# Convolutional Autoencoder

This project implements a convolutional autoencoder designed to learn efficient representations of image data. The goal is to compress and reconstruct images using a deep learning model.

## Project Overview

- **Model Implementation**: The project contains the code for building and training a convolutional autoencoder using Python.
- **Data**: The dataset used for training and testing the autoencoder consists of image files in the MNIST format, located in the `data/` folder.
- **Training**: The model is trained on a set of images to minimize reconstruction error, enabling the model to compress the input data and reconstruct it efficiently.

## Project Structure

- **ConvAutoEncoder.py**: The main script that defines the convolutional autoencoder architecture and manages the training process.
- **convae.py**: A secondary script containing utility functions related to data processing and model training.
- **data/**: Contains the MNIST dataset files (`train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`, `t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`, etc.), used for training and testing the model.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
- **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries, such as TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ConvAutoEncoder.git
    cd ConvAutoEncoder
    ```

2. **Download the Dataset**:
    The dataset is already included in the `data/` folder, so no need to download it separately.

## Running the Model

1. **Train the Autoencoder**:
    Run the main training script to train the convolutional autoencoder on the MNIST dataset:
    ```bash
    python ConvAutoEncoder.py
    ```

2. **Evaluate the Model**:
    After training, the model will output results showing the reconstruction performance on test data.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Load the MNIST dataset from the `data/` directory.
2. **Model Training**: Train the convolutional autoencoder using the training data, minimizing reconstruction loss.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance by reconstructing test images and calculating the loss.
